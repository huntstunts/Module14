## What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing the training window?

I increased the training window from 3 months to 8 months. As a result the strategic returns were slightly lower than the actual returns from 2017 to 2019 with a significant decrease in returns in 2019.
## What impact resulted from increasing or decreasing either or both of the SMA windows?

I increased the short window from 4 to 10. I believe that had an impact on the strategic turns dropping since the price to buy was higher.
## Did this new model perform better or worse than the provided baseline model? 

Since the logistic regression model was more linear, it performed better in that there weren't any significant drops in returns, but it also performed worse in that there weren't any significant increases, making it less likely to make a big profit.
## Did this new model perform better or worse than your tuned trading algorithm?

The tuned trading algorithm performed better. When comparing strategic returns and actual returns, the tuned trading algorithm was more in sync than the logistic regression model.
